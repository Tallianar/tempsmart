# TempSmart

## Installing

Install dependencies:

```shell
yarn
```

Start a development build:

```shell
yarn dev
```

Create a production build:

```shell
yarn package
```

## Tests

You can run the tests with `jest` via the following command

```shell
yarn dev
```

Renderer tests user `@testing-library/react` to test the DOM

## Development

The dev server uses the port 4000 so make sure that's available.

## TODO

Things I might have done more:

-   Run in the background
-   Better chart implementation and testing (apexcharts doesn't play nice with jest-dom)
-   Better setup of the app/window
-   More testing
-   Fetch list of cities from an API
-   Put the OWM API behind a proxy

## Conclusion

Thank you for the fun challenge!
